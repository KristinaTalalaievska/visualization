# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Your answer...
Bad example of data visualization: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/brian.moore7221/viz/USATheSummerGames/USATheSummerGames 
Good: The approach has been chosen is very creative and attract audience attention, pro-patriotic oriented for US citizens.
Bad: 
 1. Poor choice of layout and unclear content  that  makes it hard to focus on the main message.
 2. Poor Choice of Colors, and using black and white colors except the US flag highlight which is makes the chart difficult to read. The color in this chart doesnâ€™t benefit towards reading it and understanding better. Too much decorative ink (e.g., unnecessary gridlines, borders) can distract from the data related to US flag and non-visible content related to other counties. 
 3. Lack of clear labels and titles  makes a huge  challenge to understand what the data represents. In our case the some sort of labeling does appear only why navigating toward them. Missing titles and labels from the first look can confuse the viewer.
4. Lack of context and information: without  providing enough context or annotations to explain trends, outliers, or significant data points can leave the viewer guessing.
 5. Not starting the y-axis at zero can exaggerate differences between data points.
 6. Poor data-to-ink ratio.
 7. Misleading representations: implementing 3D effects or other visual tricks can distort the perception of the data, pie charts with too many slices can be hard to interpret accurately.
 8. Inappropriate chart type that  does not suit the data (e.g., using a pie chart for time-series data) can confuse the audience.

Good example of data visualization: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/pradeepkumar.g/viz/SampleSuperstoreTableauPulseEdition/Metrics
Good: 
1. Comprehensive approach, which includes the dashboard with a  broad overview of key metrics such as sales, profit, and orders. It does help to make a quick assessment of business performance.
2. Use of interactive elements that  allow users to explore the data in more detail, enhancing user engagement and enabling deeper insights.
3. Adding colors to the chart 
4. Proving explanations and context
Bad:
1. Overcrowded layout like  too much information at once. The dashboard appears crowded with numerous charts and metrics displayed simultaneously, which can overwhelm the viewer.
2. Lack of clear hierarchy there is no clear visual hierarchy (in one graph mentioned months and in another years) guiding the viewer on which information is most important.
3. Inconsistent and small font sizes, difficult to read some of the text.
4. Poor use of whitespace: overwhelming appearance makes the dashboard look cluttered and less organized.





      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
   Areas for Improvement:

For Bad Example: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/brian.moore7221/viz/USATheSummerGames/USATheSummerGames 

1. Use appropriate chart type ensuring that the chosen chart types is the best fit for the data being presented.
2. Simplifying the layout by focusing on the most critical metrics
3. Enhance readability
4. Labeling the chart bars
5. Add context and annotations that will give more information to the viewer at first sight.
6. Applying colors to the all chart, not only highlighting it partially that will improve readability.
7. Using minimalistic design will help to improve readability of the viewer  
 

For Good Example:  https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/pradeepkumar.g/viz/SampleSuperstoreTableauPulseEdition/Metrics 
 1. Simplify layout by focusing on the most critical metrics can reduce cognitive load.
 2. Enhance readability: font sizes are consistent and large enough to be easily readable, especially in charts with a lot of data points or text.
 3. Focus on key data by highlighting  the most important data points and trends to draw the viewerâ€™s attention.
 4. Being consistent in context like choosing the same time frames. 
 5. Label  the chart bars 





      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
