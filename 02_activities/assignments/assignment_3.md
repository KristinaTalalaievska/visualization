# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Letâ€™s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
        ```
### Visualization #1:  https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/pradeepkumar.g/viz/SampleSuperstoreTableauPulseEdition/Metrics

### Accessible:
The layout is clean with distinct sections, making it easy to navigate.
Allows users to interact with the data, enhancing engagement and understanding.
 Has a  good contrast, aiding visibility for users with color vision deficiencies.
However, some text elements might be too small, which can be a barrier for users with visual impairments. If not properly configured labels, it  might not provide sufficient context, hindering accessibility for screen reader users.
### Reproducible:
Its uses a publicly available or common dataset (Sample Superstore), making it easier for others to replicate the visualization.
However,  if the specific steps or transformations applied to the data are not documented, it might be challenging to replicate the results.
### Equitable:
It appears to provide a comprehensive overview of sales data without bias and allows users to interact with the data, facilitating personalized exploration based on individual interests or needs.


### Visualization #2: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/brian.moore7221/viz/USATheSummerGames/USATheSummerGames 

### Accessible:
Lack of clear interactive elements might make it less engaging and harder to explore specific data points, however the color scheme is visually engaging and may attract attention.
### Reproducible:
It's hosted on Tableau, which theoretically makes it easier for others to access and attempt to replicate. Meanwhile, the detailed and cluttered nature of the visualization may make it challenging to understand the steps needed to reproduce it.
### Equitable:
Represents a wide range of data points related to the USA Summer Games, potentially providing insights into various aspects of the events. The dense information presentation can create cognitive overload, potentially alienating users who are not familiar with the data or who have cognitive disabilities.

    - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?  
        
### Visualization #1

### Accessibility: 
 - Adjusting all text elements will make more readable.
 - Providing  detailed, contextual tooltips to assist users with screen readers.
 - Ensuring all data points and interactive elements have descriptive labels.
### Reproducibility:
 - Including detailed steps of the data preparation and visualization process.
 - Clearly mentioning  all data sources and include links if possible.
 - Offering  downloadable templates or workbooks for others to use as a starting point.
###  Equity:
- Allowing  users to customize views and filter data according to their needs.
- Incorporating  features such as text-to-speech or high-contrast modes.

### Visualization #2

### Accessibility:
- Breaking  down the information into more digestible sections or use multiple dashboards.
- Effective usage whitespace effectively to avoid overwhelming users with too much information at once.
- Including  instructions or guides on how to navigate and use the interactive features.
- Using  a color scheme that meets accessibility standards for color contrast.
### Reproducibility:
- Ensuring  that the data sources are clearly cited and accessible to others.
- Maintaining  version control of the visualization files to track changes and updates.
### Equity:
- Ensuring  that the visualization represents all relevant aspects and is not biased towards specific outcomes.
- Including  data and narratives from multiple perspectives to provide a holistic view.



- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization. 

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses learning outcomes 2 and 3:  
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story

### Rubric:
